# SDLC is a scientific approach to develop software, it also guides the development process. identifies discrete steps needed to develop software
# SDLC is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time. SDLC includes a detailed plan for how to develop, alter, maintain, and replace a software system.
# SDLC began in the 1960s to develop large scale functional business systems in the government and industries. SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specifi

# there are 6 phases in every SDLC, they are:
# 1. Planning - gatthered, analyzed, documented, and prioritized, SRS is created
# 2. Design - requieremnts are gathered from the SRS to develop the architecture , a prototype might be developed
# 3. Development - the actual code is written and the software is developed
# 4. Testing - code is tested to ensure stability, security , and that it meets the requirements from the SRS
# 5. Deployment
# 6. Maintenance
